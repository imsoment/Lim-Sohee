  It is evoked by light which has a dominant wavelength of roughly 495â€“570 nm.
  In subtractive color systems, used in painting and color printing, it is created
  by a combination of yellow and blue, or yellow and cyan; in the RGB color model,
  used on television and computer screens, it is one of the additive primary colors,
  along with red and blue, which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors.
