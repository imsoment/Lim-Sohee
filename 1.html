  <strong> Color of Visual materials - Orange&Black</strong> <br>
  <p>
  Orange is the colour between yellow and red on the spectrum of visible light.
  Human eyes perceive orange when observing light with a dominant wavelength
  between roughly 585 and 620 nanometres. In painting and traditional colour theory,
  it is a secondary colour of pigments, created by mixing yellow and red.
  It is named after the fruit of the same name.
